# Learn `iOS` Development

# Why?

If you already have/use an `iOS` device,
I don't have to waste any time
explaining the value proposition to you;
just skip straight to the "What?" section below.

If you _don't_ have/use an `iOS`, `iPadOS` or `macOS` device,
this repo/guide might not _feel_ relevant to you.

I switched back to `iPhone` from `Android` in 2021
when `Google` stopped supporting/updating my 
[`Pixel 3`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_3)
(which I _loved_) after less than 3 years of owning it.

> Android updates officially ended for the `Pixel 3` on **October 5 2021**; 3 years after it was launched.
I got mine in March of 2019 so I didn't even have 3 years. 

Meanwhile my _ancient_ 
[`iPhone 6`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_6) 
from **2014** - 
that I use for guided meditation -
still works fine.

`iPhone` have a _much_ longer useful life (on average)
than comparable devices from other brands; 
see below for _why_ ...
Yes, there are people still using 10+ year old devices
that they have taken good care of.
These people either don't _care_ about security updates
or they have rooted the decice to use a 
[custom ROM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Custom_firmware#Android)
and not need to rely on _official_ `Android` updates.
But these are definitely the exception, not the rule.

According to `Android Police`,
the average lifespan of a smartphone is 2.54-2.67 (cycle length) years.

Google _recently_ (finally) listened to customers
who complained about the short life (support cycle)
for `Android` devices and has now committed to **7 years**
of support for _new_ `Pixel` devices. 
But this is not extended back to older devices 
e.g: 5 years old,
only the `new` ones you buy from now on.

Again, my **`10+ Year Old`** `iPhone` still works without issues.
Apple has been doing a _much_ better job of supporting older devices
because they are "free money" to them.
Each _active_ `iOS` device is a potential customer for
the `AppStore`, `iCloud`, `Music` or `TV+` subscription.
`Apple` currently makes **`$96bn/year`** 
in recurring revenue from services,
so `Apple` has every incentive 
to keep older devices active.

`iPhone` is definitely not perfect,
it's a _closed_ platform with strong lock-in.
Customers effectively pay `APPL` _rent_
for `iCloud` and other services
which are _adequate_ but not amazing.

But for all the `iPhone` flaws,
it's still the most popular device in the world by far.
It's not even close.
